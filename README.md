# Magic

Bytes representative of a bit in its respective states, interchanged between chance for an interaction on a supersymmetrical resolve, within a continuum for direction towards a perpetually larger context; made for bits to individually pivot into either b or h abstractions of quarks — balanced on exchanges.

Three levels to operate the abstraction of bits into an adress for a bit in the byte; stated — inference. Between two states of inference there can be resolve to any kind of logic. Supersymmetry assurs that it is omnidirectional to the conclusion of thus many dimensions.
