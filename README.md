# Magic

Getting to know it.

1. Having a sense to it.
2. Move on.
3. Let it be.

## A brief summary

**Bytes** representative of a bit in its respective states, interchanged between chance for an interaction on a supersymmetrical resolve, within a continuum for direction towards a perpetually larger context; made level for bits to individually pivot into either b or h abstractions of quarks — balanced on exchanges.

Three levels to operate the abstraction of bits into an adress for a bit in the byte; stated — _**inference**_. Between two states of inference there can be resolve to any kind of logic. Supersymmetry assurs that it is omnidirectional to the conclusion of thus many dimensions.

Connecting the order for this logic on states interchanged without knowledge on any pre-conditions, maintains data to the clarity of direction. Above the directions there is orchestration of the means to measure differences on a larger scale; which when combined are compressed from byte to bit level in the interchange of logic for consistent coherency. Woven from smaller to larger context, while maintaining equanimity to the sides applicable in coordination, the [wiki](https://github.com/BlessWorks/Magic/wiki) is written with references in order of what needs to be done to the correlation of a _most dense_ circular understanding.

# Learning first approach

Keep an open mind and join in on the revolution _if_ **you** _**can**_.
